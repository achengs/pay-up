pay-up
======

(Under construction.)

Calculates payments due from sub-groups after a large group activity,
like payments due from families after a large dinner. Group members
can have different pay levels, like adults pay more than children.

A user basically configures a gathering (like a dinner) with groups,
members, pay levels, financial contributors. Then the app lists how
much each group owes. The user can tweak the amount owed by different
pay levels.
